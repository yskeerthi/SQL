## ðŸ”° **BASIC LEVEL DBMS QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS**

---

### âœ… **1. What is DBMS?**

**Answer:**
DBMS (Database Management System) is software that allows users to define, create, maintain, and control access to a database.
Examples: MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB.

---

### âœ… **2. Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**

| Feature      | DBMS                  | RDBMS                       |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Data storage | Files                 | Tables (Rows & Columns)     |
| Relations    | No                    | Yes                         |
| Keys         | Not enforced strictly | Uses Primary & Foreign Keys |
| Example      | File System           | MySQL, PostgreSQL           |

---

### âœ… **3. What are tables and fields in a database?**

* **Table**: Collection of rows and columns (like Excel sheet).
* **Field**: A single column in a table (like "Name", "Age").

---

### âœ… **4. What is a Primary Key?**

A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record in a table.

* It **cannot be NULL** and must be **unique**.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### âœ… **5. What is a Foreign Key?**

A **Foreign Key** is used to establish a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key in another table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  OrderID INT,
  StudentID INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(ID)
);
```

---

### âœ… **6. What is a Candidate Key?**

All possible keys that can uniquely identify rows in a table.
One of the candidate keys becomes the **Primary Key**.

---

### âœ… **7. What is a Composite Key?**

A key formed by combining **two or more columns** to uniquely identify a row.

```sql
PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID)
```

---

### âœ… **8. What are constraints in SQL?**

Constraints are rules applied to columns.
Examples:

* `NOT NULL`
* `UNIQUE`
* `PRIMARY KEY`
* `FOREIGN KEY`
* `CHECK`

---

### âœ… **9. What is normalization? Why is it needed?**

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce **redundancy** and improve **data integrity**.
It helps avoid data anomalies.

---

### âœ… **10. Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF with examples.**

* **1NF (First Normal Form):** No repeating groups. Each field contains only atomic values.
* **2NF:** 1NF + No partial dependency (non-prime attribute depends on whole key).
* **3NF:** 2NF + No transitive dependency (non-prime attribute depends only on primary key).

ðŸ“Œ Will give examples if you want a diagram or table later.

---

### âœ… **11. What is Denormalization?**

Opposite of normalization.
It involves combining tables to **improve read performance** (adds redundancy).

---

### âœ… **12. Types of JOINs in SQL?**

* `INNER JOIN`: Common records from both tables
* `LEFT JOIN`: All from left + matched from right
* `RIGHT JOIN`: All from right + matched from left
* `FULL JOIN`: All records from both tables
* `SELF JOIN`: Join table with itself
* `CROSS JOIN`: Cartesian product

---

### âœ… **13. Difference between WHERE and HAVING?**

| Clause | Used with      | Filters on | Example               |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| WHERE  | SELECT, UPDATE | Rows       | `WHERE age > 20`      |
| HAVING | GROUP BY       | Groups     | `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` |

---

### âœ… **14. What is a View?**

A **view** is a virtual table based on the result of a SQL query.

```sql
CREATE VIEW top_students AS 
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Marks > 90;
```

---

### âœ… **15. What is indexing in DBMS?**

Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval using pointers.
Works like a **book index**.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Students(Name);
```

---

### âœ… **16. What is a Unique Key?**

Like primary key, but allows **one NULL value** and still must be **unique**.

---

### âœ… **17. What are ACID Properties?**

| Property        | Meaning                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| A - Atomicity   | All or nothing                       |
| C - Consistency | DB stays valid                       |
| I - Isolation   | No interference between transactions |
| D - Durability  | Changes are permanent                |

---

### âœ… **18. What is a Transaction?**

A transaction is a group of SQL operations that are treated as a single unit.

* `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`

---

### âœ… **19. What is a Trigger?**

A Trigger is a **set of SQL commands** automatically executed when a specified event occurs (like INSERT, UPDATE).

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_marks
AFTER INSERT ON Students
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE Stats SET Count = Count + 1;
END;
```

---

### âœ… **20. Difference between DELETE, DROP, TRUNCATE?**

| Operation | Deletes  | Rollback? | Resets identity?        |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| DELETE    | Rows     | Yes       | No                      |
| TRUNCATE  | All rows | No        | Yes                     |
| DROP      | Table    | No        | Yes (removes structure) |

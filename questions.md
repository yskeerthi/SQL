**Answer**: Indexing creates a quick lookup for specific columns and speeds up SELECT queries but slows down INSERT/UPDATE operations slightly.

---

### 13. **Explain ACID properties.**

* **A**tomicity: All or nothing
* **C**onsistency: Always valid data
* **I**solation: Transactions don‚Äôt interfere
* **D**urability: Committed data stays safe
